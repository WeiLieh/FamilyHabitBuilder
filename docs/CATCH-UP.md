# Catch-up page: read this first after time away

**Last updated: [2026-11-01 16:38 SGT]** (session 7 ended). Claude updates this page at the end of every session and shows it at the start of the next. Unlike the other project files, this page is a **current snapshot**: it is rewritten each time, and older versions stay in Git history. The dated, never-deleted record of each decision is in `docs/SPEC.md` (Change notes).

## 1. Module map

The modules from your architecture diagram, coloured by progress (9 since 31 Oct: Experiments added [2026-10-31 19:06 SGT]). Numbers match the table in section 2.

[2026-10-31 09:40 SGT] The module map now lives in one place: **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** (also the source of each module's status, checked by the drift test).

**Colours:** green = built and tested; yellow = partly built; grey = not started.

**Development order (agreed):** (1) Nudge repository, then Nudge engine decisions ✅ done → (2) Datastore with event log ✅ **tables live (1 Nov)** → (3) Telegram bot, first deploy ⬅ **next** → (4) Variable rewards, then Nudge engine words → (5) Photo check → (6) Telemetry → (7) Web app.

## 2. Modules: purpose, files and tests

[2026-10-31 10:17 SGT] Each module's purpose, its files and what each one does, and which tests check it are in the module's own spec, next to its code. Status is in the diagram ([docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).

| Module | Spec |
|---|---|
| Telegram bot | [src/telegram-bot/SPEC.md](../src/telegram-bot/SPEC.md) |
| Nudge engine | [src/nudge-engine/SPEC.md](../src/nudge-engine/SPEC.md) (and its AI personality, [NUDGE-CONTEXT.md](../src/nudge-engine/NUDGE-CONTEXT.md)) |
| Nudge repository | [src/nudge-repository/SPEC.md](../src/nudge-repository/SPEC.md) |
| Photo check | [src/photo-check/SPEC.md](../src/photo-check/SPEC.md) |
| Variable rewards | [src/variable-rewards/SPEC.md](../src/variable-rewards/SPEC.md) (and its working design, [DESIGN.md](../src/variable-rewards/DESIGN.md)) |
| Datastore | [src/datastore/SPEC.md](../src/datastore/SPEC.md) |
| Web app | [src/web-app/SPEC.md](../src/web-app/SPEC.md) |
| Telemetry | [src/telemetry/SPEC.md](../src/telemetry/SPEC.md) |
| Experiments | [src/experiments/SPEC.md](../src/experiments/SPEC.md) (added 31 Oct) and its plain-English plans, [EXPERIMENTS.md](../src/experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md) |

Cross-cutting files (`src/settings.ts`, `src/sgt.ts`, `api/health.ts` and the test helpers) are listed in [docs/SPEC.md](SPEC.md), section "Modules and structure".

## 3. Rules: where each one lives

[2026-11-01 16:38 SGT] Every rule is written **once**, with its permanent ID, and each module spec starts with a "rules at a glance" list.
- **1.1 to 1.5** (users, Singapore time, no fallbacks, numbers live once in code with five kinds, "delete my data" reaches every store): [docs/SPEC.md](SPEC.md), "Cross-cutting rules"
- **2.1 to 2.4, 3.1 to 3.13**: [Nudge engine](../src/nudge-engine/SPEC.md)
- **4.1 to 4.6**: [Nudge repository](../src/nudge-repository/SPEC.md)
- **5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 3.14**: [Telegram bot](../src/telegram-bot/SPEC.md) · **5.2, 10.1 to 10.4**: [Telemetry](../src/telemetry/SPEC.md) · **5.5, 8.1 to 8.12**: [Datastore](../src/datastore/SPEC.md) (the 14 tables are listed there, under "Tables")
- **6.1, 6.2**: [Photo check](../src/photo-check/SPEC.md)
- **7.1 to 7.8**: [Variable rewards](../src/variable-rewards/SPEC.md)
- **9.1**: [Web app](../src/web-app/SPEC.md) (plus two parked questions)
- **11.1 to 11.13**: [Experiments](../src/experiments/SPEC.md); the 31 values and their five kinds are in [EXPERIMENTS.md](../src/experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md)
- Structure rules (S, R, D, B, P) and retired rule IDs: [docs/SPEC.md](SPEC.md), "Modules and structure"

## 4. Questions to think about before next session

[2026-11-01 16:38 SGT] Done in session 7: PR #15 merged (14 Datastore tables, test-first, 7 review fixes) and migration 003 applied on Supabase. Next in code: step 3, the **Telegram bot and first deploy**.
1. **Sign-up flow:** what the bot says when a parent joins with an invite code: the recording sentence (rule 11.9, a condition of joining), the photo consent question (rule 5.5), and the first name. Draft the wording in Claude Chat, or shall I draft it?
2. **Choosing behaviours and nudge times in Telegram:** these are screens, so they need your look and feel first (rule 6: "UI decisions" in `docs/CONTEXT.md` is empty). Plain Telegram buttons for now, or design first?
3. **Accounts to create before the first deploy:** a Telegram bot (via BotFather), the Vercel project, and Upstash Redis (Singapore). I'll guide each step; ready to do them next session?
4. **Claude Chat, not blocking:** the first alpha experiment (suggestion: message style).
